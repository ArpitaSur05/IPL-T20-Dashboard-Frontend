# 🏏 IPL T20 Live Dashboard - Frontend

A sleek, responsive IPL T20 Live Dashboard built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This frontend connects to a Puppeteer-powered backend that scrapes real-time data from [iplt20.com](https://www.iplt20.com) including live match schedule, mini scorecards, and the points table.

Please note that, the real time data update/notification has been implemented only for the match summary which would give information only when any live match is going on below the live-match-card.
